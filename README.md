# ai-minimax-5x6-tictactoe
This is a program created in an AI programming class which performs the Minimax algorithm on a 5x6 Tic-Tac-Toe game between two players performing optimally. Player 1 searches 2 levels down the tree while player 2 searches 4 levels down. This project was worked on by myself and two other groupmates.
